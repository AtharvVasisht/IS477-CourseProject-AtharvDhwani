# US Housing Market Valuations & Affordability Analysis
## By Atharv Vasisht & Dhwani Patel

### Overvieew ###
The US housing market has experienced significant valuation increases over the past 25 years, ranging from strong domestic net migration, low interest rates, rising income inequality, and increased costs for housing materials. To study the trend of housing prices nationwide, and more specifically understand the nuances of housing price changes across various US metropolitan areas over the past 25 years, we have decided to examine how exactly housing prices have changed, what patterns have emerged, and how homebuyers in 2025 can conceptualize this data to make adequate lifestyle/investment decisions. 

Macroeconomic trends have largely shaped housing price fluctuations in recent decades, with certain regions/metropolitan areas experiencing fast housing price appreciations (such as those in the West and South), while other regions experiencing sluggish growth due to net out migration, local industry trends, and broad nation-wide patterns that have rippled throughout housing markets. However, the purpose of this research is less about solely identifying which metros have appreciated most and which haven't, but is rather more about understanding the *why* behind these trends, and more importantly, determining the implication this has on homeowners and buyers in terms of purchasing power. Although it is relatively well known that the US middle class has shrunk in recent decades due slow wage growth and skyrocketing asset prices, the extent of disparity is something we would also like to study during this analysis. *More specifically, we want to understand, in today's housing market, how does an American's income in a given metropolitan area compare to the current housing prices in the market, the level of housing price appreciation that market has experienced (along with long-term growth expectations), and the metropolitan area's affordability (house price-to-income ratio) when compared to other metropolitan areas.*

The overarching goal of this project is to (a) identify the patterns associated with the national real estate market, and (b) provide reasoning behind practical advice Americans may follow to best leverage the existing state of the real estate market while also being aware of potential future patterns in emergence. 

### Research Questions ###
To delve deeper into the trends and goals identified above, we have the following questions we would like to answer throughout the course of this analysis and proposal:
    • Which American metropolitan areas have seen the largest housing market appreciations since the year 2000, and given these trends, which housing markets make the most sense for Americans to invest in real estate? 

    • Which housing markets are currently trading at a "discount" and which ones are 
    "oversaturated" and bound for a correction?

    • How can everyday Americans maximize their incomes to identify homes/housing markets that provide the best value in terms of present day affordability (House price-to-Income ratio) and long-term growth potential (based on historic growth rates)?

These research questions have provided us with guidance and clarity as we have continuosly identified, iterated upon, and began utilizing datasets for analysis.

### Project Timeline ###
For the project timeline, even though we have delegated tasks to an extent, we plan on working together for each of these requirements. The individual responsible for the requirement will be responsible for submitting and refining the final product we submit to make sure the responsibility is shared. We will approach this project timeline with the same cadence as we have class. So we will aim to complete 2 tasks each week, one on Tuesday and one on Thursday. The Interim Status Report will also be worked on every week to update the progress of the project for that week by Friday. This means that we will complete the project in approximately 5 weeks, putting us at Nov, 14th. We will keep the week of November 17th to make final changes and polish the final product before Fall Break. Given this timeline, we will have the week of December 3 to make any changes and adjust for any delays if we experience any.
