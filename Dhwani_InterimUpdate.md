# Update 

Overall primarily I have been focused on the data ethics and handling, as well as making sure the quality of the data remains consistent, while Atharv has been focused on the more technical components. Thus far in the project, I have worked on acquiring the data, making sure that we abide by the ethical data handling rules that Atharv outlined prior to the actual acquisition. I also transformed the BEA xlsx format into a csv format so that it would be easier to process and clean. Also I helped develop the examine_data() function to support the extraction and enrichment as we begin to clean and integrate the datasets. Atharv and I also talked about approaching the dataset using the largest 100 areas and I helped develop logic about fuzzy matching with him. Now that cleaning is done and Atharv is working on integrating the datasets, I will make sure the data quality is sufficient after the integration and begin creating logic and appropriate metric execution for analysis. Simulataneously, I am also working on structuring how we would like our analysis to be conducted after the integration step is fully completed. This will take into account the difference in timeline for the 2 datasets and how we will incorporate that into the broader research questions we have asked.
